## Application Description

"Bare Necessities JS" is a simple calendar (hence the name) with features to add events, and their related tasks. This project is a replica of my third project, "Bare Necessities", however it has been refactored to include dymnamic features only possible with JavaScript and a JSON API. For example, the new event form will submit and the page will update without a page reload. The project is loosely modeled after Googleâ€™s Calendar. Each user may choose to create their own login or login with their Google account.

Each user has the following features available to them. 

-Login with Google 
-Create an Event, with a title, description, date, start and end time. 
-Create a Task related to an Event. A user can create multiple tasks as a to-do list specific for the event. 
-The Week Ahead report which lists all events and tasks for the upcoming calendar week
-Error message generation upon submitting a form with invalid data, preventing bad data from being saved.
